# Illyasveil
A Discord self bot by 916253. Based off of Kurisu by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax. 

All this really does in its basic form is meme commands, and easy hot swapping of addons (thanks to existing code from [Kurisu](https://github.com/916253/kurisu) )

Uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).


### Warning: 
If you are in too many servers (40+), this will not be able to load properly as-is

## How to use
##### Assuming you already have the dependencies (Python 3.5+ and discord.py) installed:
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Find your [Discord token](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5ncwpv/localstorage_missing/dcalpi1/) and replace `<token for Discord bot>` inside `config.ini.exmple` with it (be sure to remove the quotation marks around it), and rename the file to `config.ini`
3. Navigate to the bot's folder in the terminal emulator of your choice and execute with run.py

## Additional addons
Additional addons can be found on [this repo](https://github.com/numberspam/Illasveiladdons), although at the moment not many exist. (feel free to submit PRs there with your own addons!)
